# Backend Engineering Challenge

To run it, you will need to cd inside the backend-engineering-challenge, and then run:
```
average_delivery_time.py input_file_example.txt 10
```
Where input_file_example.txt is the name of the file(you can change it)
and 10 is the window_size(you can change it as well)



#### Notes
It does not cover all the possible situations(like empty file, for example) and some other cases, I am aware of it.
It would require much more time to do it.

Also the tests needs to be improved, in order to catch the output and compare the results, and probably add more files with different possible inputs and run tests against them as well, but cannot spend more time on the exercise.
